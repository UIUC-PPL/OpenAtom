		OpenAtom Massively Parallel Code v1.0
=======================================================================

INSTALLATION

1. To compile OpenAtom, you need to specify the following things:
    i.   Charm++ Installation Path
    ii.  FFTW Library Path
    iii. Optimized Math Libraries

2. Before anything else, copy the machine specific Makefile.config.ARCH
   file to Makefile.config

   Linux Workstations	Makefile.config
   Abe (NCSA)		Makefile.config.abe
   Blue Gene/L		Makefile.config.bgl
   Lonestar (TACC)	Makefile.config.tacc
   Turing		Makefile.config.turing
   XT3/XT4		Makefile.config.xt3
  

2. To install Charm++, download a copy from http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu
   Depending on the architecture of the machine, choose the right
   build options and build Charm.
   If you have trouble building Charm, mail ppl AT cs.uiuc.edu

   Edit the CHARMBASE variable in Makefile.config to point to the
   Charm++ installation.

3. OpenAtom requires double precision FFTW installed in some location.
   
   Edit the FFT_HOME variable in Makefile.config to point to the
   FFTW installation. You might also need to edit the DUAL_FFTW 
   variable depending on how FFTW was compiled. It takes two values:
   DUAL_FFTW_OFF and DUAL_FFTW

4. Once this is done, you can type make in the compile directory
   and then go for a cup of coffee :)
   The binary 'OpenAtom' is placed in the binary directory
