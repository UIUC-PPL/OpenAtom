pw2openatom.f90:
This script converts wavefunctions generated by Quantum Espresso to states files for OpenAtom.
It requires qexml module in quantum espresso package.
To compile this script, place this script in PP/src directory in quantum espresso packages, and add below two lines inside of the Makefile in PP/src directory:

pw2openatom.x: ../../Modules/qexml.o pw2openatom.o
	$(LD) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ pw2openatom.o ../../Modules/qexml.o $(QEOBJS) $(LIBOBJS)

Run the executable at the working directory, 
e.g., the same directory where the <prefix>.save/ directory is located.

EXAMPLE:
<YOUR_QE_DIRECTORY>/PP/src/pw2openatom.x < input_file

In this directory, a sample input file is included (in.pw2openatom). 

====================================
INPUT FILE DESCRIPTION

prefix : it has to be the same as pwscf run
work_dir : directory where you saves your wavefunction files.
fsysname : system information file to be used for OpenAtom execution. The name of this file is hardcoded in OpenAtom as "sysinfo.dat". 
doublepack : Default value is 'false'. 
shift_flag : To calculate Polarizability when G=G'=q=0, we use shifted wavefunctions. If you have calculated occupied state wavefunctions with k grid with small shifts, make this flag true. 
gpp_flag : If true, it prints density file ("rho.dat") that is used for GPP calculations. 
Vxc_flag : not implemented yet.
