TO BUILD:
============
Checkout and build Charm++ for the architecture you plan to run on:
> git clone https://charm.cs.illinois.edu/gerrit/charm
> cd <charm directory>
> ./build charm++ <arch> --with-production -j8

Common values for <arch> are:
  - pamilrts-bluegeneq-smp    when running on a BG/Q machine
  - netlrts-linux-x86_64-smp  when running on a linux workstation
  - multicore-darwin-x86_64   when running on a Mac workstation

Set up the build configuration file:
- Copy config.mk.template to config.mk
(Use config.mk.anl_template instead when running on ANL machines)
- Edit config.mk to set up your configuration

Important PATHS in config.mk:
- SRCDIR:   The full path to your gw_bse directory
- CHARMDIR: The full path to your charm build from above
- BUILDDIR: The full path to where you want the build files to go
- CHARMC:   Do NOT change. The path to the charm compiler

To use LAPACK, the following options must be set in config.mk:
LAPACKLIB:  Linker commands needed to link to LAPACK
LAPACKINC:  Add -I include paths needed for LAPACK
CFLAGS:     "-DUSE_LAPACK $(LAPACKINC)" must be set
LFLAGS:     "$(LAPACKLIB)" must be set

To use CkLoop, the following options must be set in config.mk:
CFLAGS: "-DUSE_CKLOOP" must be set
LFLAGS: "-module CkLoop" must be set

Other flags:
CFLAGS: "-DQ_IDX=X" is used to set the Q point at compile time to X
DIRS:   The list of subdirectories used in compilation. Do NOT change.

TO RUN GW/BSE:
==============
On your local workstation:
- Copy charmrun and gw_bse from the build directory you set in config.mk to the
  top level directory of the dataset you wish to run on. A test dataset is
  included in the 'input' directory of the repository
- Switch to your data set directory and run the following, where X is the number
  of processors you want to run on:
  > ./charmrun +pX ./gw_bse <config file>

The config file defines certain runtime variables used by the gw_bse. An example
configuration file can be found in 'input/minjung_test_file'

If the run does not start because of ssh being unable to connect, add the
++local option to your run command right after the +pX option.

If there you get the "<config file>.out already exists" error, you must run a
tidy script to clean out data from previous runs. An example tidy script can be
found in 'input/tidy'.

On an ANL machine: (WIP)
- Copy gw_bse from the build directory to your dataset directory. We will be
  using 'runjob' to start the job instead of charmrun.
- When you have an allocation run the following command to run on X nodes, with
  Y threads per node:
  > runjob
