Scalar routines we need:
	1. Exc (LDA)
	2. Hartree short
	3. e-N short
	4. long range (g space) will be later

For 3. e-N short, for myAtms, compute phi_J(rf) <-- a structure
	we can compute the energy of each atom by summing over rf, we
	also need the self term by using the partial wave expansion.

For 2. Har short, compute the phi_J(rf) which requires sending
	around nearest neighbor core densities.

For 1. Exc, everything is local, you just need the density in
	the core, which includes the smooth density.

New variables for PAWINFO class:
	 i) number of PAW atoms
	ii) list of PAW atoms
 iii) the list of PAW atom types
	iv) for each type, we need a FGRID (copy it from the old dir/),
			and we will make a pup for it, so it can be a substructure
			of PAWINFO (PAWINFO will probably pick up a number of sub-
			structures, FGRID will be the 1st one)
	 v) number of PAW atom types

In PAWrhoChare, the constructor will make model densities, and we
	will send them to our scalar routines, and compare the results
	to the original model compensation charge. After that, we can try
	a model real density combined with the model compensation charge
	density. Once that works, we will take n-partitions and create
	the densities. If all that works, we shove it into OpenAtom.
