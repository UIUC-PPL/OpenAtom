======================================================================
1) We go through all these routines, and change any routine that has a double precision number in the call
   or in the body to the same name just replacing d with q (dggev goes to qggev)
2) We change any d0 d- d+ to q0 q- q+ in the code
3) We also change the file name from d to q (dggev.f goes to qggev)
4) We make sure we call the q rountines where needed and update all the external statements
5) Delete any unchanged routines
6) compile all the qstuff.f -c
7) Make a library of all the .o
     "ar rvs libqggev.a qfile1.o qfile2.o qfile3.o ..."
