We go through all these routines, and change any routine that has a double precision number in the call
	or in the body to the same name_long 
Next, we make sure we call the _long rountines where needed by dggev
We delete any routine we did not rename
We make a little compile script for the renaming routines which we will package into a library called "dggev_long"
When we try this, we link dggev_long and lapack
