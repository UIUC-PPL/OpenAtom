1. if you create a new file or directory: git add name
	never do git add * b/c you don't want junk like executables in the repo
2. after adding any new stuff or changing old stuff, you commit your changes: git commit -a
3. to make sure to don't overwrite anybody else: git pull
4. when you are done making all your changes: git push

DON'T FORGET STEP 3, OR YOU'LL OVERWRITE SOMEONE ELSE'S WORK!!
