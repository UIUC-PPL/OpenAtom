/** A 2D chare array bound to CP_State_GspacePlane that manages the driver logic and related communication details.
 * 
 * Implements entry methods that are primarily used by other chares for notifying progress on different portions 
 * of the computation. This information is used to orchestrate the work. Holds counters and flags used in the GSpace 
 * driver logic that is currently implemented as RTH code. 
 * 
 * Use starts with the creation of the numInstances bound arrays in init_state_chares(). InstanceController::doneInit() 
 * then invokes startControl() which creates an RTH 'thread' and lets it fall through its logic. The intricacies of the workflow
 * should be evident in GSpacePlane's documentation and in the RTH code comments. RTH invokes different functions and entry 
 * methods and suspends when needed. The RTH 'thread' resumes when someone calls resumeControl().
 * 
 * Moving to other solutions like sdag should mostly result in very localized modifications.
