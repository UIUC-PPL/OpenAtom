  This code has been developed to provide a framework for quantum mechanical
  computation involving 3-D FFTs. 

  A look at the file cpaimd.ci might be helpful to get a high level idea of 
  the objects.

  *******************************************************************************

  Status of the code now:
  One iteration of program execution does the following:

  * FFT the states from G-Space into Real-Space
  * Sum the squared densities over states.
  * Compute the Hartree energy and Energy correlation and sum them
  * Multiply the sum with the Real-Space wave function
  * Compute the inverse FFTs from Real-Space to G-Space
  * Compute forces using particle computation
  * Compute total forces and move electrons
  * Perform orthonormalization.
  * repeat the loop.

  *******************************************************************************

  To compile and link the program 
  1) Edit Makefile.config to point to your Charm++ installation and FFTW installation.
  2) After that do a make in this directory
  3) The execuabtle is src/cpaimd


  *******************************************************************************
  Running the program:

  The only command-line argument to the program executable is the name of 
  a configuration file. A default configuration file is included in the src/
  directory, "cpaimd_config". This has to be modified to indicated the
  directory in which the state files can be found. The other parameters need
  not be necessarily changed.

  Running:
  % charmrun +p8 ./cpaimd cpaimd_config
  *******************************************************************************

  Reading the code:

  The current code is not extensively documented. However, there are comments
  describing the basic purpose of functions, and a title comment 
  describing the life-cycle of each chare. The important files are GSpacePlane.C,
  ParticlePlane.C, RealSpacePlane.C, RealSpaceDensity.C, RhoGDensity.C,
  S_Calculator.C and ortho.C.

  As a basic guideline, start reading code from GSpacePlane::doFFT(),
  and try to follow the flow of control/data through Charm++ messages.
