Instructions: Create PIMD ring polymers from a classical config
-----------------------------------------------------------------
   1) ./compile.sh
   2) ./make_directory.sh ATOMS_IN  7
     (./make_directory.sh top_level_dir  numbeads-1)
   3) ./spread.x input_file
   4) example input_file=spread.input
   5) example coordinate file (classical config)  = coords.in
=================================================================


Example spread.input file contents:
4 1475145.0 initial          : pi_beads,seed,start_typ (intial/restart_pos)
1.0  300.0                   : rcut in Angstrom , kT in Kelvin
coords.in ATOMS_COORDS_IN water.coords_initial : filenameIn,directorynameOut,filenameOut
masses.in  : masses in amu

4 = number of beads
seed = random number generator seed
start_type = initial means output is in Angstroms, restart_pos means in atomic units
rcut = does not allow the spread of the ring polymer to exceed this number in Angstroms
       this is to keep things reasonable since only the springs are sampled in this
       setup which tends to make the intial guess too "fluffy"
kT = temperature of beads
coords.in = input coordinates for one bead
ATOMS_COORDS_IN = directory specifying where to write the bead positions (one subdirectory per bead)
water.coords_initial = what the coordinate output is called inside those subdirectories
masses.in = file containing atomic masses in amu
