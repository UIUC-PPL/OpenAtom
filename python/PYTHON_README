Python File Description

1) test_driver.py
  Main driver of the python code. Reads in either a config file specifying many
  tests, or a single test configuration of (data set, exe dir, test name). It
  makes calls to parse the tests and run them, calling sys.exit with the number
  of failed tests.

2) test_parser.py
  Defines a single function, parse_test, that takes a data set path, exe path,
  and test name, and generates a list of test dictionaries by reading the config
  file for that test. It returns the list of test dictionaries, which can then
  be passed to the test_runner to be run.

3) test_runner.py
  Defines a function, execute_tests, which takes a list of test dictionaries,
  runs the tests, and compares the results to the output references. It uses the
  test_checker module to check results, the test_output module to print a
  summary of results as the tests are run, and the test_util module to prep
  tests for execution. It also defines a helper function for generating commands
  from a test dictionary.

4) test_checker.py
  Defines a top level function for checking the results for a given test
  dictionary as well as many helper functions to aid in checking. There is a
  function for isolating the target iteration in the output, comparing keys
  between output and reference, stripping numbers out of a line of text, and
  comparing numbers to a desired precision. The top level function returns a
  pair (Boolean, String) with [True, ''] if the test passed, and
  [False, 'Reason'] when a test fails.

5) test_output.py
  Various functions for neatly printing output of test results.

6) test_util.py
  Utility functions for cleaning up a data set before running it's tests.
