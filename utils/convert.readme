The "convert" script converts a dataset to the new directory
structure format.

Run "convert" in the folder where your dataset is stored.

Convert defaults to assuming that your initial coordinates are in
water.coords_initial, if that is not the case you should pass your
coordinates file as an argument on the command line.
