The "setup" script creates the output directories necessary
for OpenAtom to run.

Run "setup" in the run directory of OpenAtom.  The run directory
must have the STATES and ATOM_COORDS_OUT folders (or symlinks to
    them) for the script to run correctly.

This script should only need to be run once each time you create
a new run directory.
